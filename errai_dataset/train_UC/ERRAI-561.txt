Need a way to automatically "RootPanel.get().add(navigation.getContentPanel())"
In order to use Navigation, a user must currently:

{code}
@EntryPoint
public class App {
 
  @Inject
  private Navigation navigation;
 
  @PostConstruct
  public void clientMain() {
    RootPanel.get().add(navigation.getContentPanel());
  }
 
}
{code}

Which could be simplified by assuming that the following means Navigation should be configured automatically:

{code}
@Page
@EntryPoint
public class App {
 
 
}
{code}

This could be further simplified if the trigger is @Page used anywhere in the client code:

{code}
@Page
public class AnyClientClass {
  
}
{code}

Injection of a Navigation manager should perhaps override any default or automatic configuration, it could still be added, but simply supply a handle to the Navigation manager already added to the RootPanel.
