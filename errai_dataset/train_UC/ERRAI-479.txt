BindableProxyGenerator tries to override static methods
Compiling a project with the following model object:

@Bindable
public class Department {
  public static Department resolve(EntityManager em, String name) { return null; }
}

causes this compile-time failure:

03:24:44.928 [ERROR] Errors in '/Users/jfuerth/git/errai/errai-jpa/demos/errai-jpa-demo-grocery-list/target/.generated/org/jboss/errai/databinding/client/BindableProxyLoaderImpl.java'
03:24:44.928 [ERROR] Line 86: This instance method cannot override the static method from Department

The method referred to in the error message (line 86) looks like this:

      public Department resolve(EntityManager a0, String a1) {
        final Department returnValue = agent.target.resolve(a0, a1);
        agent.updateWidgetsAndFireEvents();
        return returnValue;
      }
