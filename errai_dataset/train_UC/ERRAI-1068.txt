Extend EnabledByProperty annotation to allow multiple conditions
Currently, it is only possible to use 
{code:java}
@EnabledByProperty
{code}
to match if a system property contains a "true" value.
Some other scenarios could be useful, such as defining a default value in case the system property is not set as well setting a matching value other than only "true".
Ex: 
* Checking that a system property matches a specific value as "enabled" or "disabled".
* Having it enabled by default in case the system property is not set.
