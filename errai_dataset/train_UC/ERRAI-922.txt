MarshallerImpl will fail to generate if there are too many @Portable Types
We have a large number of @Portable types.  Currently, the getMarshaller(String) is done in a single method, which, for large number of types will exceed the size available in java.  The error message is:

[ERROR] Line 2336: The code of method getMarshaller(String) is exceeding the 65535 bytes limit

This used to happen on the BootstrapperImpl, but was fixed by chaining together a series of smaller classes.
