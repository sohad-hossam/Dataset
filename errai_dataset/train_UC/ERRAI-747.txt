IOC container reports unresolvable bean with injection cycle involving interfaces on both ends
The following 4 types together make an injection cycle that Errai IOC has trouble with:

{code}
public interface Cycle1TypeA { Cycle1TypeB getBInstance(); }
public interface Cycle1TypeB { Cycle1TypeA getAInstance(); }

@ApplicationScoped
public class Cycle1TypeAImpl implements Cycle1TypeA {

  @Inject
  private Cycle1TypeB bInstance;

  @Override
  public Cycle1TypeB getBInstance() {
    return bInstance;
  }
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class Cycle1TypeBImpl implements Cycle1TypeB {

  @Inject
  Cycle1TypeA aInstance;

  @Override
  public Cycle1TypeA getAInstance() {
    return aInstance;
  }
}
{code}

There are two known workarounds:

1. Switch one or both of the injection points to inject the concrete type rather than the interface
2. Switch one or both of the injection points to inject Instance<Cycle1Type[AB]>, which manually breaks the injection cycle
