Add navigation error callback
When _manually_ entering an url with a page that doesn't exist in the NavigationGraph, the exception IllegalArgumentException("Page not found: \"" + name + "\"")  is thrown.

in this case it would be good to have the possibility to pass in an error callback to the navigation, such as Navigation.addErrorCallback(...).

the information passed in could be an enum to distinguish the errors. in case no callback is defined, the IllegalArgumentException can be continued to be thrown.
