Failed to to compile marshaller class
It appears that spaces in the classpath are not properly escaped when Errai attempts to compile its static marshaller class.  In the snippet below, the space seems to end the classpath and "UI" is processed as an option.

I should also note that running Maven in debug mode doesn't provide additional information.
