@PathParam regex incomplete support 
There is a hole in the path param detection with regex containing brackets.

Indeed, the regular expression used in [https://github.com/errai/errai/blob/master/errai-jaxrs/errai-jaxrs-client/src/main/java/org/jboss/errai/enterprise/rebind/JaxrsResourceMethodParameters.java#L58] does not take into account the internal brackets that might be present in the PathParam regular expression.

This is due to a limitation in the Java Regular Expression library that can not find balanced members of a string.

However, Resteasy works fine with these regular expressions, so I looked into it to find out how it did it. The answer is in its [https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/blob/master/jaxrs/resteasy-jaxrs/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/util/PathHelper.java#L51] class. They replace internal brackets programmatically with an unlikely used character, apply the regex to find pathParamNames and associated regex, and then replace the characters back to brackets.

In the mean time, the only available workaround is to replace the *\{n\}* syntax with *n* times the repeated group/character: *[A-Z]\{3\}* becomes *[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]*.
