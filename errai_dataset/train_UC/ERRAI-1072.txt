ErraiApp.properties - add parameter errai.ui.nonbindableTypes logically similar to errai.marshalling.nonserializableTypes
It's very convenient to have an ability to exclude some classes from data binding proxy generation depending on, for instance, build profile. I.e. initially many classes are annotated with @Bindable, but when building for mobile some of them are not needed for sure.
Also it would be nice to have wildcards support, like com.xx.mm.canvas.* excludes all bindable classes under this namespace.
