ClientMessageBus fails to start with ArithemticException (\ by zero)
There's a chance that the client message bus fails to start. The reason for this is how the client id is calculated:

{code}
clientId = String.valueOf(com.google.gwt.user.client.Random.nextInt(99999)) 
+ "-" + (System.currentTimeMillis() % 
(com.google.gwt.user.client.Random.nextInt(99999)));
{code}

Random.nextInt returns an int between 0 (inclusive) and upperBound (exclusive) which might cause a division by zero in the statement above.
