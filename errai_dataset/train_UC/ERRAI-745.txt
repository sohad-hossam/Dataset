Bean validation for collections of bindable types fail when elements are proxies
When validating a collection of bindable types Errai can't unwrap the potentially proxied list elements which causes the proxy fields to get validated instead of the actual fields.

Example:

{code}
@Bindable
@Portable
public class ComponentData {
    @Size(min = 5, max = 10)
    private String title = "";
 
    @NotNull @Valid
    private List<Data> dataList = new ArrayList<Data>();
}
 
@Bindable
@Portable
public class Data {
    @Size(min = 1)
    private String name = "";
}
{code}

If {{dataList}} contains plain {{Data}} objects everything works as expected. However, validation won't work if {{dataList}} contains bindable proxies of {{Data}}.
