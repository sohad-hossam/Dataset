A single DataBinder instance should support binding a bean property to multiple widgets
A single DataBinder instance currently limits a property binding to at most one widget. The reason this limitation is in place is to consistently support the InitialState.FROM_UI use case where the initial state of the model is synced from the UI.

However, InitialState.FROM_UI does not seem to be a required feature, as the model is always bound before the UI is updated (the UI doesn't change without a bound model). All our existing examples only use InitialState.FROM_MODEL to sync the UI state from the model when the UI is first displayed. So, we should retire the InitialState feature and just always sync from the model. 

Then we can easily implement support binding a single property to multiple widgets.
