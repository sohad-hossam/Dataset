Add hints to "no proxy provider found" error message for case when new remote service is added in SDM
When a new RPC interface is created during in an SDM session (Bus or JAX-RS) the GWT compiler does not retrigger the respective proxy generator.

The error message in this case gives no help in resolving the issue, and should be updated with hints on the possible ways of resolving the problem which are:
# Touching/modifying a pre-existing RPC interface (one that already has a generated proxy).
# Clearing the SDM cache and refreshing.
# Running SDM without incremental compilation.
