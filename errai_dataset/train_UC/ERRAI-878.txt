Callback Event Dispatcher is not using the right ClassLoader to load application event class
I attempted to use [Errai CDI Callbacks|http://docs.jboss.org/errai/3.2.0.Final/errai/reference/html_single/#sid-21758054_Events-Conversationalevents] from the server to the client for the first time but I received ClassNotFound exceptions for the event class. Upon further analysis it appears that the EventDispatcher class was performing a Class.forName lookup of the class. This is a problem for my environment since I include the Weld and Errai libraries in the Jetty server classpath instead of the application classpath.
