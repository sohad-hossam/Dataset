Support for bindable property chains 
Errai's data binding module should support chaining of bindable properties. E.g the following binding expressions should work, given that Address is a @Bindable type:

{code}
@Bound(property="customer.address.streetName")
{code}

or

{code}
dataBinder.bind(widget, "customer.address.streetName")
{code}
