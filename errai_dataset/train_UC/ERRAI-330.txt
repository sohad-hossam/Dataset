public @Portable variable of an abstract superclass causes "no such field" in generating marshallers for @Portable subclass
In trying to generate a marshaller for "SubObject":

@Portable
public class SubObject extends ParentObject{
     public SubObject(){}
}
 
public abstract class ParentObject{
     public ParentObject(){}
 
     public Id id;
     public Id getId(){
          return this.id;
     }
     public void setId(Id id){
          this.id = id;
     }
}

...where "Id" is another portable class. This leads to "no such field: id in class: com.mypackage.shared.SubObject. Removing the "public" modifier from "public Id id;" avoids the error. This limitation did not exist in Errai 1.3.2.
