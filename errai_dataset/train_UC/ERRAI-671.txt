Build/Compilation hangs when running with only one CPU
Based on this thread: https://community.jboss.org/message/845380?et=watches.email.thread#845380
I've manage to reproduce the issue installing VirtualBox with Ubuntu 13.04
The errai compilation hangs when Virtual Box has only one CPU enabled.
It doesn't matter the JDK or Maven Version that you use, it's only related with the amount of CPUs enabled. 
I've tested the issues with three different applications which involve ERRAI compilation, all with the same results.
