@Templated annotation for an extended class fails unless the value field is exactly the same as the parent
When the HTML template has a datafield fragment called #form that spans the entire HTML document, and it is included in the value field of the @Templated annotation for the parent class, a child class does not work unless it also includes the same fragment, and gives a bad error message about a missing datafield in the child.
