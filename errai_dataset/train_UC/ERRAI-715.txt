Make Errai Forge Addon less brittle regarding user modifications to project
Currently the Errai Forge Addon requires precise configurations for any of the commands other than setup to be run. This is fine for getting started, but if a user tweaks some values in their pom.xml (or other config files) they may no longer be able to use commands in the addon.

Dependencies should be strictly required, but *.xml configurations should be more flexible so that users can still take advantage of the addon after doing manual modifications.
