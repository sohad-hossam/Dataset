Implement an explicit kill switch for the client-server bus federation
For Errai 2.1, we plan to sort out the framework's internal dependencies so that you don't have to include the bus module at all.

In the mean time, for the 2.0 release, we should at least provide a client-side configuration option that prevents the ClientMessageBus from communicating with the server: some sort of "maintain radio silence" switch. There are tons of use cases, but opting to do all communication over Errai-JAX-RS is one of the most obvious.
