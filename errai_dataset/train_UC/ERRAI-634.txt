Performance issues in DevMode after recent changes
The errai client/server communication becomes really slow when you have more than one tab opened (same user and same browser).

In order to reproduce the issue it's necessary to clone and build locally our repos:

Beginnign with:
https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap

In this repo you'll have to add manually @ kie-parent-with-dependencies/pom.xml the latest errai version (something like we had here: https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/ec09d0a4f672bbeaaf30cf1d4a6f9e88364a76d6/kie-parent-with-dependencies/pom.xml)

after that all you need is clone and build local the following repos:

https://github.com/droolsjbpm/kie-commons
https://github.com/droolsjbpm/uberfire
https://github.com/droolsjbpm/guvnor
https://github.com/droolsjbpm/kie-wb-common
https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools-wb

In order to test, go to author perspective, select mortgages and open the Dummy rule.drl... open the same file in both browsers and start to see how slow it becomes.

In order to test the same events.. just open a file in both browser tabs, then rename the file in one tab... you'll get a message in the other. And for an unknown reason if you close and open the same file again.. it get slower and slower.
