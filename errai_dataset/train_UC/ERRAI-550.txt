Unable to turn off log messages generated from DefaultBlockingServlet
The poll method in DefaultBlockingServlet.java is calling printstacktrace() to log exceptions in it's catch block.

While trying to stop the ClientMessageBus , the onfly GET requests are being aborted resulting in ClientAbortException in DefaultBlockingServlet , as a result the catch block is printing the stack trace by printStackTrace()method which cannot be turned off by using application level logging.
