Errai does not compile in strict mode
I found this problem using Errai version 2.4.1.Final for a project.
When I use strict gwt compile mode, the compilation fail for Errai classes. Test code is included in the jars and has a dependecy on GWTTestCase.

I was able to reproduce the problem with the Errai JAX-RS quickstart archetype. The bug does not appear in the version 2.3.2.Final but as soon as I upgrade Errai to 2.4.1.Final or 2.4.2.Final the archetype does not compile in strict mode.
