Injecting on fields that have corresponding setters results in failure
For example, the following class fails injection:

{code}
@ApplicationScoped
public class BeanInjectsNonModuleDependentBeanB {
  @Funject ArrayList<String> funArrayListOfString;

  public void setFunArrayListOfString(ArrayList<String> funArrayListOfString) {
    this.funArrayListOfString = funArrayListOfString;
  }
}
{code}

The IOC container is incorrectly reasoning that it cannot perform the injection specifically for method injection because the dependent scoped bean is not marked as available.
