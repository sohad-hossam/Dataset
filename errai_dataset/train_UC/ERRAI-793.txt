Page not reloaded correctly if user navigates to same page but with different page state values.
If user is on Page A, and page state values are changed manually in the URL bar, the page is not reloaded with the new values. The @PageShowing method does not get called.

However, if navigation.goTo() is directly called, this problem does not occur. See test case https://github.com/divd/errai/commit/271fabde13eeea74b6d46524872fac0ee5596872. This code executes as expected.
