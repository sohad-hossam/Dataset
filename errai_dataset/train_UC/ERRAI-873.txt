Websocket transport bus re-connect after network failure
When a network failure occurs using the websocket transport the WebsocketHandler will automatically try to reconnect, and send a Associate command to the server.   Because the server already has a QueueSession with the same id marked as active it never sends a Successful Negotiation message and the client side bus never changes its state back to ONLINE

Proposed fix is to add
        sendMessage(queueChannel, WebSocketNegotiationMessage.getSuccessfulNegotiation());

To line 57 of WebsocketNegotiationHandler.java in the errai-bus module.
