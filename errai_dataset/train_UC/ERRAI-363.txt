Codegen can't see fields of anonymous inner classes
The code generator does not include fields of anonymous inner classes in the scope of that inner class. Example:

    public class A {
      public void outerMethod() {
        Runnable r = new Runnable() {
          private Object I_AM_INVISIBLE = what.ever;
          public void run() {
            System.out.println(I_AM_INVISIBLE);
          }
        }
      }
    }

In the above example, the reference to I_AM_INVISIBLE in the run() method will cause an out of scope error when generating the Java code.

The workaround is to refer to I_AM_INVISIBLE using a StringStatement.

The fix would be to include I_AM_INVISIBLE in the scope of the inner class (right now, the scope is reported to contain a "this" reference and nothing else).
