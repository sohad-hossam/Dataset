Allow the addition of primitive attributes to entities that have been persisted
Scenario:

Say I had a class called Beer in release 1.0 of my app:

@Entity
public class Beer {
  @Id @GeneratedValue
  private long id;
  private String name;
}

and now in version 2, I want to add a field called "rating":

@Entity
public class Beer {
  @Id @GeneratedValue
  private long id;
  private String name;
  private int rating;
}

now when users who have used version 1.0 of the app try to use version 2, the EntityManager will throw a NullPointerException whenever it tries to retrieve an instance of Beer from local storage. The problem boils down to an attempt to assign null to the primitive field rating. This isn't a problem for non-primitive types because they can handle null values.

It would be convenient if adding primitive attributes to existing entity types was not a fatal error requiring all of localStorage to be cleared.
