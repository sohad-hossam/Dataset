ClientMessageBusImpl catches exceptions in MessageCallbacks, preventing @UncaughtException Handing
When executing code in a RemoteCallback (after a service call to the server), all exceptions are caught by ClientMessageBusImpl rather than the method annotated with @UncaughtException as would be expected.  ClientMessageBusImpl is catching exceptions from our code (not related to the messaging) (line 673).

It would be nice to be able to control the exception handling at this point (or for it not to handle it at all).
