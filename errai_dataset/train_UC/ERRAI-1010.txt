Remove warning about missing no-arg constructors in normal scope beans
For every normal scoped type (such as @ApplicationScoped), if the type uses constructor injection and doesn't have a no-argument constructor, Errai logs warnings of the form:

The class $CLASS must be proxiable but does not have an accessible no-argument constructor

Often this isn't a problem, and when it is Errai fails at runtime with an error naming the problematic type in the console. Hence this compile-time warning is unnecessary.
