Support for javax.enterprise.inject.Typed
Consider this simple example about two client side managed beans:
  interface Viewer<T> {}
  interface Editor<T> extends Viewer<T> {}
The injection point for Viewer<T> will resolve the Editor<T> instances as well, even if the editors have the '@Typed(Editor.class)' annotation.
