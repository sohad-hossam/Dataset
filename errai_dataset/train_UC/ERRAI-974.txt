CDI events not observed on client for indirectly implemented interfaces
If you fire an event for a type that indirectly implements and interface, observers of the indirectly implemented interface do not observe the event.

For example if you have IfaceB extends IfaceA, and you have Impl implementing IfaceB, then an Event<Impl> will not be observed by an observer of IfaceA.
