jax-rs jackson subcollection serrialization issue
if you have the class for example:
public class Foo{
    private List<Bar> barCollection;
}

and second class
public class Bar{
    private List<Contact> contacts;
}

and another one

public class Contact{
    private Integer id;
    private String name;
}

than if you create a rest services, that rescive type "Foo", than you get exception, becouse "contacts" property of "Bar" type can not be successfully serrialized to jackson.
