Data Binding doesn't react on changes that happen outside a property's write method (outside the corresponding setter method)
If a bean property is manipulated from within a method of the model class that is not the corresponding setter method, Errai's data binder will not be able to see and react to these changes.

E.g.
{code}
public void foo() {
  this.active = true;
  setActive(true);
}
{code}

We can fix this by doing a full comparison of the target model's state with the bindable proxy's state whenever a method is called on the proxy to detect which properties have changed.
