ContextualProviderInjector NPE for classes without generic
In org.jboss.errai.ioc.rebind.ioc.injector.basic.ContextualProviderInjector
the variable pType declared in line 54 is null after the switch if the class which should be injected by an ContextualTypeProvider has no generic types.

Don't know if the bug is a missing null check or the MetaField class that returns null for getParameterizedType(). Because the getParameterizedType method has no javadoc.

The class java doc of org.jboss.errai.ioc.client.api.ContextualTypeProvider says that it gives the class types if they are present so i assumed that it can handle classes without them.
