Clean up dependency scopes in Kitchen Sink archetype
The following jars are deployed with the .war file you get from a fresh project created from the kitchensink-quickstart archetype:

Exclude:

* errai-cdi-jetty-2.0.Beta2.jar
* guice-servlet-2.0.jar
* javax.inject-1.jar
* jboss-servlet-api_3.0_spec-1.0.0.Final.jar
* weld-servlet-1.1.5.Final.jar
* weld-build-config-1.1.5.Final.jar

These are questionable, but we think we should leave them in because we want client-side validation behaviour to be identical to server-side validation behaviour:

* validation-api-1.0.0.GA.jar
* validation-api-1.0.0.GA-sources.jar
