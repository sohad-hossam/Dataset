example "errai-jpa-demo-grocery-list" - NullPointerException on the page "ItemListPage"
When some item with the empty "name" is created and then the page "ItemListPage" is rendered the NullPointerException is thrown and neither the form nor the list is rendered.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. build and deploy the example "errai-jpa-demo-grocery-list" (EAP 6.1, profile: jboss7)
2. go to the page "ItemListPage" (click on Items or click on the "Try The Demo!" button)
3. Create an item with the empty "name"
4. Refresh the page

The cause:
In Java class "ItemForm" the method "setupSuggestions" tries to add null value to the MultiWordSuggestOracle which throws the NullPointerException

Possible solutions:
1. Add some validation to the form - not to allow to save an item with the empty "name".
2. In the Java class "ItemForm" in the method "setupSuggestions" replace "iso.add(i.getName());" with something like "iso.add(i.getName() == null ? "" : i.getName());"
3. Change the sql query which retrieve the list of items.
