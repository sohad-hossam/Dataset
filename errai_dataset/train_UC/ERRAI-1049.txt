EmbeddedWildFlyLauncher without wildfly home configured should give an error message that says it's due to the wildfly home missing
This is getting started experience (= important to attract more users)

1) When I configure `-server org.jboss.errai.cdi.server.gwt.EmbeddedWildFlyLauncher`, I didn't add `-Derrai.jboss.home=...` yet, because I wanted to see if it would at least get to that launcher and report an error such as "The required property errai.jboss.home is missing."

It did crash, but the error message is very different, so for new users this is very confusing to figure out how to fix it:

{code}

This is just with this config on the tbroyer plugin

{code}
            <devmodeArgs>
              <arg>-server</arg>
              <arg>org.jboss.errai.cdi.server.gwt.EmbeddedWildFlyLauncher</arg>
            </devmodeArgs>
{code}


2) When I add:

{code}
            <systemProperties>
              <errai.jboss.home>/foo/bar/doesNotExist</errai.jboss.home>
            </systemProperties>
{code}

I get the exact same error message (so I have no clue if it's being picked up, even though it was). I should get a different error message: "The required property errai.jboss.home (/foo/bar/doesNotExist) does not exist as a directory."
