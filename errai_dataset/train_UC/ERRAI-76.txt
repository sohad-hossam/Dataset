Closing login window makes it disappear permanently
Closing the login window should send an anonymous challenge to the server (ie. attempt to login without credentials). This was the behaviour before.  This will normally result in a failed login, but it provides the ability to bypass the login in certain systems where a guest login (ie. login bypass) is considered appropriate.
