Resolution of @Templated with fully qualified path name fails
I annotated one of my pages with: @Templated("/at/w0mb/ErraiPlayground/client/local/PageLayout.html").

Compilation fails with: "Finding resources
[INFO]                      [ERROR] Resource at/w0mb/ErraiPlayground/client/local/pages/login//at/w0mb/ErraiPlayground/client/local/PageLayout.html not found. Is the name specified as Class.getResource() would expect?"

According to the documentation this should be possible.
