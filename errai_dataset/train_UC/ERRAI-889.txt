Errai Navigation Removes Leading Slash from Paths
Errai Navigation removes leading slashes from page paths when push state is not used.

For example, if a site is hosted at {{mydomain.com}} and the page path is {{/path}}, then Errai Navigation changes the url to {{mydomain.com/#path}} when the desired path is more likely {{mydomain.com/#/path}}.
