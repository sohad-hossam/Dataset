IOCBeanManager doesn't find concrete classes extending Abstract
Unable to look up concrete types from parent abstract types in the bean manager. For instance:

{code}
interface Activity {
...
} 

public abstract class AbstractMyActivity implements Activity {
...
}

@Dependent
public class MyActivityImpl extends AbstractMyActivity {
...
}
{code}

And looking up with the following fails:

{code}
Collection<IOCBeanDef> beans = iocBeanManager.lookupBeans( Activity.class );
{code}
