Use PageState to Retrieve a Bindable Model to Populate a Page
It would be really useful to be able to retrieve a Bound Model from the server using a PageState as a key.

Example use case: On an Account Info Page, information is displayed using a Bound User object.

Using the proposed feature we would lookup the relevant user doing something like this:

{code:language=java}
@Page
public class AccountPage {

  @PageState
  Integer userId;

  @Model
  @PageState(map={"userId":"id"}) // id is a field in User
  private User user;

  @Bound
  @Inject
  private TextBox name;

  @Bound
  @Inject
  private TextBox age;

  // et cetera...
}
{code}

Thus we could automatically retrieve entities from the server simply by declaring a mapping form PageState to a key used to lookup the object.
