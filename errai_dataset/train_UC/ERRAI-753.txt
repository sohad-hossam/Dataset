Fix IOC bean creation ordering issue between ClientSyncManager and beans with Sync annotation
The SyncDecorator generates initialization code that indirectly makes a {{getInstance}} call to the bean manager for the {{ClientSyncManager}}.

There is currently no guarantee that the singleton instance of the {{ClientSyncManager}} has been created (unless you explicitly inject the {{ClientSyncManager}} into the class with the {{Sync}} annotation).
