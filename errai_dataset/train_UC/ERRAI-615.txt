JAX-RS Demarshalling does not handle subclasses
If my JAX-RS class signature is:

public BaseClass getObject() {
    return new SubClass();
}

The generated JSON code will correctly send out "SubClass".

However, the client stub is generated statically, and will demarshall as "BaseClass".

Changing the return type to Object goes through the generic Object demarshaller, that does return the correct subclass.

This can be worked around with a custom marshaller (even one that simply delegates to the Object.class demarshaller), but it would be better if the framework supported this functionality out of the box.
