Support marshalling of types with abstract or interface fields
Errai should be capable of marshalling portable types that have abstract or interface fields as long as the runtime types are marked as portable e.g.

{code}
@Portable
public class MyPortable {

  private MyInterface field1;

  private MyAbstractClass field2;
}
{code}
