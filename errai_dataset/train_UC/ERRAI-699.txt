Errai Security redirects users away from secured pages when app loads, even if they are logged in
Currently Errai Security uses a cached {{User}} instance to decide if a user has authorization to navigate to a page. If the cache is not yet populated, it is assumed the user is logged out and they are redirected to the login page.

If an app is initially loaded on a secure page, the cache will not yet be populated, so this page load will always result in redirection.

A few potential solutions:
# The initial page load could wait for the caching RPC to complete.
# A cached {{User}} could be kept in the browser's local storage.
# There could be a new {{UniquePageRole}} for loading, which could be redirected to while we check if the user is authenticated.
