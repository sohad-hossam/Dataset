Nested Maps with different Key Types don't work
Consider the case:

HashMap<Long,HashMap<String,Object>> map = new HashMap<>();

When marshalling, he DecodingSession (ctx) variable has an assumedMapKeyType, assumedMapValueType, and in this case, there are two different key types.

The marshalling fails.
