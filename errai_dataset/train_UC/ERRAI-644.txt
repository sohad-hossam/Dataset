[Errai][Navigation][Security] Only "admin role based" item from Navigation Bar menu can be hidden
Indeed, I implemented what has been explain at http://planet.jboss.org/post/security. 
The problem is only admin item in a navigation bar which is associated to the "admin" Roles can be hidden.
 
@Inject @DataField @RequireRoles("admin") Anchor admin;

I tried with other role names but it does not work.
