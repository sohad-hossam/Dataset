Array marshaller generation causes rebind error
In some cases generating an array marshaller may fail because of a missing generation context. This may be caused by the fact that array marshallers are always regenerated even if the MarshallerFactory (which creates the context) is not.

Array marshallers were originally uncached because of generation issues in classic dev mode, but this workaround is no longer needed for SDM.
