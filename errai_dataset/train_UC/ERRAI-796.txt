Support for JsonTypeInfo and inheritance with Jackson
Seems, the Jackson support is very limited: I have a simple Hirarchy in my Model and Errai doesn't seems to support it with the Jackson-Wrapper.

Server sends it correctly (jersey), but the Erray is ignoring the type-attribte. When sending something to the Server, the attribute is not added.

Would be nice to add the supported Features to the Docu, too.



ExampleCode::
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "type")
@JsonSubTypes({ 
   @Type(MyTestModel .class),
})
public class TestModel
...
public class MyTestModel extends TestModel
