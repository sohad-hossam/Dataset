EventHandler annotation should allow registering for events on "this"
It's not uncommon to want to handle events happening on the templated widget itself (for example, click, mousein, mouseout, keyboard, etc.)

One suggestion would be to allow the string "this" to stand for the object the method is declared on (or inherited by).
