websocket avertised address is not accessible
The address sent back the client with the websocket address is of the form : ws://<ip>:<port>/path

Not sure if this is common, but where I work the company's browser proxy.pac config file can't handle IP addresses and tries to send them via the internet. 

It would be good if the hostname could be used instead of the IP address. Configured or determined.

Not sure how it hangs together, but the url is built in ServerMessageBusImpl and WebSocketServerHandler.
