Marshaller generator tries to create marshallers for all nested types of a @Portable entity
I have an entity where it contains a Builder static member class.  The entity is annotated with @Portable, where the static member class isn't.

If the member class does not have a public no-args constructor then the marshallers fail to generate any code.

@Portable
public class BalanceSheet {
...
    public static class Builder {
        public Builder(String someArg) {
            this.someArg = someArg;
        }

        public build() {
            return new BalanceSheet(someArg);
        }
    }

    public BalanceSheet(@MapsTo("someArg") String someArg) {
        this.someArg = someArg;
    }

    ...
}
