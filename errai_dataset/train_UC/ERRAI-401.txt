CDI events fired on the client are implicitly conversational when received on the server
CDI events fired on the client are implicitly conversational when received on the server (no matter if @Conversational is present on the event type or not). If the server (re-)fires the event it will only be sent to the one client which originally fired the event but not to all clients (broadcasting the event is not possible).

Example including workaround:

{code}
@ApplicationScoped
public class OrientationService {

  @Inject
  private Event<Orientation> orientationEvent;

  public void onOrientationChangeFromClient(@Observes @FromClient Orientation orientation) {
    // event will only be visible to the client that originally fired the event
    orientationEvent.fire(orientation);
    // copied event will be broadcasted to all clients
    orientationEvent.fire(new Orientation(orientation));
  }
}
{code}
