Client-side BeanManager fails to look up beans using an extended interface type
In the following scenario the BeanManager fails to look up both implementations of interface A.

{code}
public interface A {
}

public interface B extends A { 
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class AImpl implements A {
}
 
@ApplicationScoped
public class BImpl implements B {
}
{code} 

Both AImpl and BImpl are managed beans of type A (B extends A), so {{beanManager.lookupBeans(A.class)}} should return both beans but currently doesn't.
