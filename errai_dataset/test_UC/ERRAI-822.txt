GWT 2.7.0: Reconfiguring logging via ErraiSystemLogHandler appears to be broken.
With Errai 3.0.4 + GWT 2.7 the logging configuration doesn't appear to be working.  

I tried to modify the default configuration as described at https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ERRAI/Logging but when I use code like this:
{code}
  private void logConfig()
  {
    LoggingHandlerConfigurator config = LoggingHandlerConfigurator.get();
    ErraiSystemLogHandler handler = config.getHandler(ErraiSystemLogHandler.class);
    handler.setLevel(Level.ALL);
    log.debug("Should now see debug-level messages!");
    log.error("And this is an error-level message.");
  }
{code}

Here's what ends up getting logged to the console:
{code}
16:11:01 SEVERE [App] And this is an error-level message.
16:11:01 SEVERE [WireActivityLogger] Remote logging failed: 
{code}

NOTE: The debug message is not logged and a remote logger got enabled for some reason (leading to errors since I don't have the remote logging servlet enabled).
