Marshaller loses instances constructed in wrong order
Having an instance multiple times in the same serialization graph can cause the instance to be null depending on order of constructor parameters.

If the instance is used first in a List it is lost (null on every occurence), if it is stored directly first (exchange the parameter order) it works as expected
