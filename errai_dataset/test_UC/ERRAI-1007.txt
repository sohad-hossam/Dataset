Append (and attach) GWT widgets to HTMLElement
It would be great to have a way to append (and attach) old GWT widgets to a HTMLElements. Right now, we have this way:

HTMLElement htmlElement = TemplateUtil.<HTMLElement>nativeCast( c.getElement() );
header.appendChild( htmlElement )

But doing that only works once a widget has been attached. It will be awesome if we have some utility method that attaches and append a GWT widget to an HTMLElement.
