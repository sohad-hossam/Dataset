Named CDI beans appear nameless when looked up via an interface type or supertype
Take the following beans:

{code}
public interface CreditCard {}

@Dependent @Named("visa") public class Visa implements CreditCard {}
{code}

A bean lookup for CreditCard.class or Visa.class both produce a reference to the same bean type (Visa) but the lookup of CreditCard.class yields a bean descriptor for which getName() returns null.
