Add gatekeeper functionality to Errai IOC
The HAL console project uses GWTP's @Gatekeeper feature to avoid loading UI code that is not applicable to the current environment. For example, if you attach to a standalone server, the UI components for managing a domain-mode server will not be used. The GWTP gatekeeper provides the application developer a declarative API for specifying which views should or should not be loaded under certain circumstances.

At first, we thought we would add this functionality to Errai security, but after some exploration we realized it would be more general and potentially more useful if a gatekeeper could be specified on any IOC bean.

There are some outstanding questions to answer:
 * should the gatekeeper be able to hide a bean in the bean graph entirely, or would they only affect a flag (eg. on the IOCBeanDef interface)?
 * should gatekeepers be allowed only on 'leaf' bean types (i.e. those that are only looked up programmatically, and do not appear at any @Inject point)
