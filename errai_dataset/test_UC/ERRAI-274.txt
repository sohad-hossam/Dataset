ProxyMaker generates code that does not compile
There are cases where our ProxyMaker generates code that won't compile:

* When the proxied class contains static methods (the actual proxy class tries to override the static methods which is wrong of course)
* When methods of the proxied class throw checked exceptions (the overridden methods do not contain the corresponding throws declarations)
