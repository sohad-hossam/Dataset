Having an option on @DataField for alternative attribute merging strategies
Hi Errai Team,

We have some issues in to our GMD Widgets that everytime we inject the component widget it overrides it's class for e.g.

*Inside WelcomPage.html*

{code:html}
<div data-field="icon" class="red-text"></div>
{code}
*Inside WelcomePage.java*
{code:java}
@Inject
@DataField("icon")
MaterialIcon icon; // this component has setStyleName("material-icon"); on its constructor.
{code}
*This is the MaterialIcon architecture*
{code:java}
    /**
     * Creates an empty icon.
     */
    public MaterialIcon() {
        super();
        addStyleName("material-icons");
    }
{code}

*Question*
Can we avoid overriding the stylename once it's being rendered ? Instead we can append it so that it will not break the initialization of predefined class into MaterialIcon widget.

*Conclusion*
This feature request was discussed on this Github Issue thread https://github.com/errai/errai/issues/170#issuecomment-216293832. And we would to have an option on @DataField for alternative attribute merging strategies might be a good idea.
