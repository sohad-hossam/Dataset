Event observers in the client that do not have corresponding default injectors with the same annotations cannot be addressed.
For instance:

In the client:
{code}
public void observesEvent(@Observes @Foo Bar evt) { 
  ...
}
{code}

and on the server:

{code}
class Foo {
  @Inject Event<Bar> barEvent;

  public void fireEventWithFoo() {
    barEvent.select(new Foo() { 
      public Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType() { return Foo.class; }  
    }).fire(new Bar());
  }
}
{code}

The dynamically selected qualifier is never routed on the ErraiBus because Errai does not see the @Foo case.
