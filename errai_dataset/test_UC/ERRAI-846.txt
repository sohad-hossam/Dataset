errai.compile.perf.perform_reachability_analysis is not documented yet warning/error generated
This compiler property, if not set to true, raises a WARNING yet no documentation references it. 

When I set it to "true", my client side code didn't work anymore. If this feature is experimental I think it should be mentioned in the documentation as such.
