Separate Auto DataBinding from dependency on Errai-UI
Currently, the only way to use annotations to decorate a class for data binding is to use it in conjunction with Templated (Errai-UI) classes.  There is no reason that Model to HasValue binding can't be 'auto bound' independent of the Errai-UI.  Otherwise, ErraiDatabinding, which looks like a very powerful feature, has its use tied to the layout mechanism being used, which seems like an unnecessary requirement.  

There are many reasons one would not want to use the Errai Templating library for UI presentation (either not use it altogether, or in specific circumstances).  Especially when migrating a project, it would be beneficial to be able to make changes in pieces.
