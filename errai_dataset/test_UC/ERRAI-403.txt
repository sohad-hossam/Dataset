demarshalling map of abstract classes throws nullpointer exception
I have a class Test which contains a map of type <String, Job> where Job is an abstract class. so there are specialized classes which extend job. on demarshalling the map I get a nullpointerexception. with beta1 everything worked fine. 


MapMarshaller throws nullpointerexception since beta1

CR2 line 88

final Object demarshalledValue = ctx.getMarshallerInstance(valueType).demarshall(ejValue, ctx);

valuetype is Job and not the specialized class. as it is abstract no marshaller exists.
