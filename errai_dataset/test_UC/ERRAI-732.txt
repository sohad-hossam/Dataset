Investigate Fine-Grained Authorization Rules for Errai Security
There is a seemingly common use-case for more fine-grained access control that is not met by the current role-based access control in Errai Security. We should investigate adding more fine-grained authorization.

Some questions that should be examined:
* Should this feature replace or enhance the current access control?
* Do we want to a more sophisticate User/Role model (maybe involving permissions)?
* Or would it suffice to allow the user to define their own access control logic that hooks into existing security lifecycles/events?
