Catch "bad payload" exception ... subsequently a Chrome bug (Websocket)
The Chrome browser sends a second (unexpected) message (which is valid but empty) when a message was > ~145KB. This results in a RTE "bad payload" because no Errai message can be produced. A further problem is now, because this RTE is not catched and results in a closed socket channel after this error case.

Most robust solution is to catch any Errai specific exceptions in the endpoint.
