BootstrapperImpl generation fails with abstract class + generics
This scenario works under 2.2, so something in the 3 branch breaks this.
Basically, the bootstrapper compilation fails when using an abstract class marked with generics, and an @Inject into the abstract class.  Having multiple classes extending the abstract class breaks it.
