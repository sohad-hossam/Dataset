Source directory names of the rest-tx modules need improving
The source directory names of the REST modules is confusing and does not accurately reflect what they are for. Currently we  have:
{noformat}
rest-tx
  tx
  integration
  util
  webservice
{noformat}
which I'd like to rationalize to:
{noformat}
rts (RESTful Transaction Service)
  at (Atomic Transactions)
    tx (the JAX-RS service that implements the spec)
    integration (simple API for writing Java based participants)
    util (various utility methods for making it easy to conform to the spec)  
    webservice (bundles tx as a deployable war)
{noformat}
(and later on we'll add jdi at the same level as at).
