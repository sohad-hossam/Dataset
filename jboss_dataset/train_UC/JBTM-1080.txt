XTS Interop tests should use Shrinkwrap to create the interop11.war
Currently we need to package the XTS test artifacts before the tests can be ran:

{code}
./build.sh -f XTS/localjunit/WSTX11-interop/pom.xml install
./build.sh -f XTS/localjunit/WSTX11-interop/pom.xml test -Parq
{code}

This is because the maven built interop11.war is deployed as part of the Arquillian tests:

https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/master/XTS/localjunit/WSTX11-interop/src/test/java/com/jboss/transaction/txinterop/interop/WarDeployment.java

If Shrinkwrap was used to create the interop11.war artifact, we could simpley call the following line to run the tests:

{code}
mvn test -p arq
{code}

This is also a pre-requisit for having the tests run as part of a top level "mvn test".
