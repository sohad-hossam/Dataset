In the trace logs you can see:

Here you will notice that the transaction is removed before the last participant record is removed. There is a bug in ATSubordinateCrashDuringPrepare.txt and BASubordinateCrashDuringComplete.txt that will only shutdown the VM if the transaction log is the last to be removed.
