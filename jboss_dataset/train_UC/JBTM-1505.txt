WS-BA transaction context not propagated if JTA transaction present.
With default-context-propagation enabled:

What happens if the Client is running in a JTA transaction, then begins a WS-BA transaction before calling a WS-BA enabled service? I suspect, as it stands, we would start a WS-AT transaction as well. This will cause the JaxBaseHeaderContextProcessor to default to WS-AT as it appears first in the if-then-elseif block:

{code}
            final CoordinationContextType coordinationContext ;
            if (atContext != null)
            {
                coordinationContext = atContext.getCoordinationContext() ;
            }
            else if (baContext != null)
            {
                coordinationContext = baContext.getCoordinationContext() ;
            }
{code}

I'm not yet sure how we handle this case. We certainly need a test for it though.
