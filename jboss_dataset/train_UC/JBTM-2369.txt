Include output of the hardware used when reporting benchmark results
Anything we can get from the OS would be useful. If we can't get vendor and spec automatically we will need to identify these manually and maybe have a document somewhere that we can link to in the results.

e.g. ran on haverstraw, haverstraw spec is http://narayana.io/perfmachinespecs/haverstraw.html

Or something like that.
