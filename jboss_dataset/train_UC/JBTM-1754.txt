Make project names consistent in poms
The project names used in the build are not consistent which makes it difficult for someone unfamiliar with the project to debug build issues.

Some examples are provided:
||Dir Name||Artifact ID||Project Name||Proposed Name||
|/ArjunaJTA|narayana-jta-all|JBoss JTA everything|Narayana: ArjunaJTA|
|/ArjunaJTS/narayana-jts-idlj|narayana-jts-idlj|JBossJTS packaged module with idlj stubs|Narayana: ArjunaJTS idlj|
|/ArjunaJTS/orbportability|orbportability|JBossJTS orb portability|Narayana: ArjunaJTS orbportability|

The project names can be changed without disrupting the way the build works, so these should be changed to match the dir and artifactId as much as possible.
