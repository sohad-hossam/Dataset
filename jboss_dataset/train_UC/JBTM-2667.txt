JDBC Connection leak with Postgres
When using Narayana's JDBC TransactionalDriver with a Postgres XA datasource, the connections are never closed.

 The problem can be workarounded by adding a modifier :
{code:java}
ModifierFactory.putModifier ("postgresql native driver", -1, -1, PsqlConnectionModifier.class.getName());  
{code}

With a modifier, the close method is called on the XAConnection object, with no modifier it's called on the Connection object.
