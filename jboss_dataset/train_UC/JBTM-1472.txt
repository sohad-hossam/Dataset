Initial version of Compensations API
We essentially provide a JTA-like implementation for using compensations. We would support distribution over Web services and REST via WS-BA and REST-JDI. This is similar in how we do distributed ACID transactions today; the application is developed against the JTA, but through configuration we enable distributed transactions over a particular transport (remoting, IIOP, WS).

It would be good to have some subset of functionality that worked on a raw VM (i.e. no appserver). This would hopefully broaden the market.

This first piece of work is to do some initial research and support an API with potentially a subset of features of the final API.

Tasks:

# Investigate existing WS-BA APIs
## Try code examples if possible
# Produce an initial list of features that should be covered by the API
# Create a simple implementation backed by WS-BA.

Implementation work, to complete this issue:

# Manage lifecycle of transaction via the @Compensatable annotation
# Allow Compensation and Completion handlers to be registered via annotations
# Mechanism for allowing application to mark the transaction as CompensateOnly
# Merge into Narayana code base
# OOTB support in WildFly
