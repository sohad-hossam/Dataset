JCA committed inflow transaction is not moved to assumed completed category for JTS
We have test which checks whether EIS is capable to finish transaction after JVM crash.
The scenario is following:
- 2 test XA resources are enlisted
- EIS RAR XATerminator calls prepare and commit
- JVM crash occurs at the start of the first XAResource.commit call
- app server is restarted
- doRecoveryScan()/waitForOrphanInterval/doRecoveryScan()
- both (mock) XAResources are not rolled-back
- EIS XATerminator.commit is called
- doRecoveryScan()/waitForOrphanInterval/doRecoveryScan()
- both (mock) XAResources are committed

but the committed tx is not removed from log:
