Race condition between BlackTie subsystem and Artemis starting up
Occasionally TcpServer tries to lookup ConnectionFactory before Artemis has started that component.

Solution is to delay the lookup until the subsystem is accessed which should work and at least will not bork the TcpServer thread and fail the entire subsystem until reboot.
