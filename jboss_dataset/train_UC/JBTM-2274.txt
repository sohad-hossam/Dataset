Create separate assumed complete type for heuristic transactions
Currently all JTS transaction records are moved to assumed complete store after 3 recovery tries. This is not good if the transaction has a heuristic outcome. It leads to the heuristic participant being rolled back, because recovery coordinator cannot see the log record after the move.

Creating separate locations for such heuristic transactions and checking their status during replay_completion would solve the problem.
