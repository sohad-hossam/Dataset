The coordinator does not flush its cache of transactions as they timeout eventually resulting in OOM
When transactions timeout (when the client abandons them or errors out) the org.jboss.jbossts.star.service.Coordinator holds references to the 
org.jboss.jbossts.star.resource.Transaction in the transactions Map. So eventually the Coordinator goes OOM.
