Expose timed delivery feature of hornetq in btenqueue
It would be good to be able to specify a delivery time for the message (either relative or absolute) in the btenqueue.

on #jbossts it was discussed and apparently HornetQ does support this so it just needs to be exposed to the blacktie interface.
