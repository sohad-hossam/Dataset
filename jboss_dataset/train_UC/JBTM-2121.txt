Add a jdbc object store implementation for later revisions of MySQL driver
commit 44553931 updated the MySQl driver to 5.1.28.

In this revision of the driver, it is reporting as mysql, not mysql_ab. It should be possible to duplicate our mysql_ab_driver to mysql_driver in order to catch both cases.
