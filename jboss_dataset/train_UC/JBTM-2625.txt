Errors during reading the object store state may result in incorrect presumed abort semantics being activated
In the method getOsStatus the error handling ignores various errors that may occur and proceeds to return ActionStatus.ABORTED

Method is defined here:
https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/5.2.13.Final/ArjunaCore/arjuna/classes/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/recovery/ActionStatusService.java#L245

The method is intended such that if we get a successful access to the ObjectStore but can’t find any states corresponding to the Uid (vector size is 0) then we can return aborted due to presumed abort. 

Currently if we have a failure during lookup we may also have vector size of 0 but that doesn’t mean the transaction has aborted; it just means we had a failure and should retry later.
