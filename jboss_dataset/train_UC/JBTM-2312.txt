Wrong logging format of ARJUNA016005
Logging format of warning warn_recovery_failedtorecover is strange or maybe better to say wrong. It looks:
{code}
WARN  [com.arjuna.ats.jta] (Periodic Recovery) ARJUNA016005: JTS XARecoveryModule.xaRecovery - failed to recover XAResource. status is $2 
{code}

This message came from XAResourceRecord.xaRecoverySecondPass and it's message warn_recovery_failedtorecover. The code with dolar sign seems to me a bit confusing.
I think it would be better first not have the dolar sign there and second rather to print string representation of the error code.
