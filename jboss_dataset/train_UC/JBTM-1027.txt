Create a script to simplify XTS crash-recovery logs
Currently the crash-recovery logs are very cumbersome to check. I propose we create a post-processing script that:

* Replaces transaction and participant IDs with uniq integers.
* Remove duplicate messages, keeping the last occurance
* Spilt log into clear before and after crash sections
* Add a title to log file, stating the name of the test
* Add a link to the original log file
