use XAResourceWrapper metadata for assume complete
In the XA protocol a time window exists wherein the RM has committed and thus forgotten a tx branch but the TM has not yet deleted its log. A crash during this window currently results in an unrecoverable situation, as the TM assumes the branch belongs to an RM that is uncontactable and will retry recovery indefinitely. This stems from an inability to relate the Xid to a specific RM.  It can be overridden globally with JTAEnvironmentBean.xaAssumeRecoveryComplete, but we would prefer more fine-grained control.  With the availability of RM id information from XAResourceWrapper this becomes feasible.
