If a class cannot be deserialized safely, try to fallback and use the XARecoveryModule to locate an appropriate XAResource
This exception happens with using the IBM MQ rar in the wildfly.

com.ibm.mq.connector.xa.XARWrapper is the serialize object.  when the RecoveryManager tries to restore_state from the object record, it will load the class and threw CNFE as it can not access the XARWrapper classe in the RAR

We can catch this exception and try to get from the helpers.
