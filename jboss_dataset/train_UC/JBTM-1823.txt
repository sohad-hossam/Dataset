Narayana fails to build on a codebase not checked out of SCM
To reproduce:

* go Here: https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/releases/4.17.4.Final
* Download and extract the zip
* run: './build.sh clean install -DskipTests'
* Observe:

{code}
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:buildnumber-maven-plugin:1.0:create (default) on project arjunacore: Cannot get the revision information from the scm repository :
[ERROR] Exception while executing SCM command. UnsupportedOperationException

[ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command
[ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :arjunacore
{code}

Alternatively, it works if you do this:

{code}
git clone git@github.com:jbosstm/narayana.git
git checkout 4.17.4.Final
./build.sh clean install -DskipTests
{code}

It seems to be because the maven plugin is expecting the code to be checked out of SCM. We need to make the build tolerant of this scenario.

NOTE: it also happens for the 4.17.5.Final zip.
