LRA logging is wrong in pointing to tsLogger and using System.out
The LRA module uses inconsistent way of logging. Some parts uses the {{com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.logging}} which is wrong as it should define its own logger category to use in LRA. Other ones uses {{System.out|err}} for printing log information.

Up to that there should be more consistency and more informative for user.
* There are hidden reasons of some failures in some places. 
* The error messages get from the URL queries are unclear in some cases, e.g.
  {{not present: null: Cannont connect to an LRA coordinator: Connection refused}}
  (what does means {{not present}} and why {{null}}? this is a bit misguiding info which is not necessary to be part of the error message)
