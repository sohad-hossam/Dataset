RecoveredTransactionReplayerUnitTest may raise a nullpointerexception
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at com.arjuna.ats.internal.jts.recovery.transactions.RecoveredTransactionReplayer.run(RecoveredTransactionReplayer.java:118)
	at com.hp.mwtests.ts.jts.recovery.RecoveredTransactionReplayerUnitTest.testCommitted(RecoveredTransactionReplayerUnitTest.java:71)

Looking at the test it spawns a thread to call run(), then it expects that the thread hasn't finished launching before doing further setup. Then it triggers the logic that is expected in the thread anyway.

I will not trigger the thread which should have the same test behavior but without the timing issue.
