The new thread association listener does not handle the Arjuna behaviour that TM::resume(null) == TM::suspend for us
AtomicAction treats a null resume as a suspend. The code for the listener does not appear aware of this special behaviour.

PR to come shortly to help explain (including comment in AA so you can see where the behaviour is defined).
