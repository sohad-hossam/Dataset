Remove some noisy logging that adds no value
The following log lines appear _a lot_ when TRACE is enabled for 'com.arjuna'

||Count||Message
|656|2013-11-29 08:08:14,893 TRACE [com.arjuna.ats.jta] (EJB default - 1) BaseTransaction.getStatus

A total of almost 1,200 lines combined for those three messages after running a single transaction. This makes it a pain to read through the logs as you need to fight through pages of these statements.

I don't think they provide any value in their current form. Can they either be removed or improved?

See the attached log for an example.
