Byteman tests fail when running with the IBM JVM
Byteman instrumentation does not work with the IBM J9 JVM:- it fails with errors like the following:

{code}
*** java.lang.instrument ASSERTION FAILED ***: "jvmtierror == JVMTI_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE" at JPLISAgent.c line: 1009
Exception in thread "Attachment 59984" Agent failed to start!
JVMJ9TI064E Agent initialization function Agent_OnAttach failed for library instrument, return code 102
{code}

I will implement a workaround by disabling byteman when testing with this JVM.
