Remove log4j.properties from jbossjts.jar
The archive jbossjts.jar contains a log4j.properties file, which creates a transaction.log file.

It can be disabled by specifying -Dlog4j.defaultInitOverride=true, but that is not always possible for some Ant tasks, like checkstyle. Hence an empty file is created.

It would nice to have the logging configuration outside of the archive.
