Compensations API tests hit by ParticipantCompletion Race condition
This issue is documented here: JBTM-1429

This issue is to fix the tests so they tollerate this issue. This can be solved easily using Byteman, in the same way as we solve it for other tests.

In the documentation for JBTM-1429, we state that this issue is unlikely to happen in a distributed environment. This is true, however, the Compensations API is designed to work local-only as well as distributed over WS-BA. See JBTM-1718 for the real fix to this issue.
