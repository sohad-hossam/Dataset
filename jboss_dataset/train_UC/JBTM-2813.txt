Cli operation for listing transactions returns not only transactions but participants too - for JTS inflow txn
This is a follow-up from JBEAP-6307 where change JBTM-2767 (Allow JTS JCA imported transactions to have clearHeuristic called on their participants) was part of it.

That seems to bring wrong behavior of cli operation for listing transactions when JTS inflow txn is in use. Currently I do observe that operation [1] lists not only transactions as it should but there are listed participants of transaction as well - what is not expected.

When inflow transaction is prepared then I can see (the testcase contains only one prepared transaction at the time which consists of two test XAResources)

[standalone@localhost:42042 /] /subsystem=transactions/log-store=log-store:probe()

[standalone@localhost:42042 /] /subsystem=transactions/log-store=log-store:read-resource()

    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "expose-all-logs" => false,
        "type" => "default",

            "0:ffff7f000001:-f30b80c:58480e0a:2c" => undefined,

My test causes that one participant ends in heuristic state thus recovery is processed only for the second one. After recovery is processed the listing changes to

I'm adding the content of {{tx-object-store}} at both phases and the {{server.log}} as well.
