build-release-pkgs.xml contains 4.17.0.Final version number
See: https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/master/build-release-pkgs.xml for 4.17 and master.

Notice:

{code}
<!-- The tag as it appears under svnbase -->
<property name="pageName" value="4_17_0_Final"/>
<property name="tag" value="4.17.0.Final"/>
{code}

I assume this should be set to the current release. Also, we need to update the release procedure to understand the '_' notation used in the 'pageName' property.

This is assuming that these properties are even needed? They appear to be svn related, in which case not needed for Narayana 4.17 and 5.
