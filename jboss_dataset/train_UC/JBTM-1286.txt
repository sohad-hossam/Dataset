Update TXFramework tests to catch application Exception
See: http://172.17.131.2/view/Narayana+BlackTie/job/jbossts-narayana-java7/16/

It looks like an update to JBossWS now means that the application exception thrown by the Web service is re-thrown by the client stub. In the past a SOAPException was thrown.

The tests need to be updated to expect the new exception.
