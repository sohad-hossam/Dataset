 CrashRecovery02_2_Test01 failure
The root cause of the failure is that StatusChecker#getStatus gets a different exception when trying to obtain the transaction status. With JacORB it gets OBJECT_NOT_EXIST but with JdkORB orb it gets CORBA.BAD_OPERATION. In the former case we assume that the original transaction is dead and get a fresh one to do recovery on. In the later case we log the error and abort the replay attempt.

The recommended fix is to mark the original as dead when we get CORBA.BAD_OPERATION when doing the status lookup.
