Services do not enlist RMs if the client begins a transaction 
If a client starts a transaction and makes a service call then service does not enlist the RMs into the transaction.

When the service creates an HttpControl instance for the incoming transaction it needs to repopulate the _enlistUrl and _endUrl by calling HttpControl::headRequest().
