JTS ExtendedResourceRecord cannot cope with a LastResourceRecord operating in 2PC mode
ERR calls prepare, which calls LRR prepare which calls XARR commit_one_phase, which cleans up the CORBA servant.

ERR then calls doSave which fails as the remote servant is cleaned up but can cope with this

ERR then calls commit but gets an OBJECT_NOT_EXIST which ERR lumps in with SystemException and the ServerTopLevelAction returns this as a error, it should detect this case and allow 2PC to complete normally
