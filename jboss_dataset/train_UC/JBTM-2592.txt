Incorrect warning messaging in ShadowingStore
warn_objectstore_ShadowingStore_6 currently says ...

"ShadowingStore::read_state() - no type name given for object state"

... when in fact the else clause is triggered when the state isn't committed or uncommitted (typically when it's unknown and the state doesn't exist).

I'm not sure when this warning message was added because it wasn't there in JBossTS 4.8 or 4.15.3.

I'm going to fix this issue (the text). I'll create a separate issue because I think this should be info not warning.
