SPI additions for enlisting XA resources
Two additional items are required:

* org.jboss.tm.ConnectableLastResource shouldn't extend LastResource in order to make it a mix-in interface that can be used for XA resources too;
* promotion of com.arjuna.ats.jta.resources.StartXAResource to the SPI.
