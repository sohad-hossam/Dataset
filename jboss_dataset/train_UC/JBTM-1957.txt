XTS crash recovery tests fail on IBM JDK
The XTS crash recovery tests fail on IBM JDK. This seem to be a problem of Arquillian settings.

What I do:
- switch to IBM JDK (JAVA_HOME + PATH)
- export JBOSS_HOME=/home/ochaloup/jboss/jboss-eap-*
- cd XTS/localjunit/crash-recovery-tests
 - mvn test -Pxts.integration.tests.profile  -Parq -Dtest=com.arjuna.qa.junit.TestATCrashDuringOnePhaseCommit

What I get - tests fail with error:
