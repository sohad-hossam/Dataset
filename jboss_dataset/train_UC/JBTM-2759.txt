string_literal: The string literal "__LOCKS_MAP" is an interned string.
  interned_string_lock: Locking on an interned string can cause unexpected locking collisions with third party code.
  Instead of using "__LOCKS_MAP" as a lock, create a final field of type Object which is only used as a lock.
