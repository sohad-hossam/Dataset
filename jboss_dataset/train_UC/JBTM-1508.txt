DisabledContextPropagationTest fails when standalone.xml content is updated by jboss-as
Currently we copy across a modified version of standalone-xts.xml. The problem is that this file needs to be kept in sync with the original. 

The main problem is that these tests will fail every time an upstream change is made to standalone-xts.xml.

This problem is related with com.arjuna.wstx.tests.arq.ba.DisabledContextPropagationTest, com.arjuna.wstx.tests.arq.basic.DisabledContextPropagationTest, and org.jboss.jbossts.txbridge.tests.outbound.junit.DisabledContextPropagationTests
