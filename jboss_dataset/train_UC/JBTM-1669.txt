Remove tanukisoftware wrapper dependency from EAP6 profile
Currently we have tanuki in these components:

{code}
ArjunaCore/arjuna/services/pom.xml
ArjunaJTS/narayana-jts-idlj/pom.xml
ArjunaJTS/narayana-jts-jacorb/pom.xml
pom.xml
{code}

{code}
    <dependency>
      <groupId>tanukisoft</groupId>
      <artifactId>wrapper</artifactId>
      <version>${version.tanukisoft}</version>
    </dependency>
{code}

We need to remove these dependencies from eap6 profile according to comments from Fernando:

We do not ship  tanukiwrapper with the AS (the windows on is an exceptional case and for different reasons).

It is not in the AS7 dependencies, and it will be hard for Support to
properly rebuild TS in the field.

btw, there are two classes we need to remove from eap6 profile which depends on tanuki wrapper:

{code}
ArjunaCore/arjuna/classes/com/arjuna/ats/arjuna/services/recovery/RecoveryManagerService.java
ArjunaJTS/jts/services/classes/com/arjuna/ats/jts/services/transactionserver/TransactionServerService.java
{code}
