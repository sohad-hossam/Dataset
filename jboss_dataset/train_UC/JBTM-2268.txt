The last run (http://172.17.131.2/job/narayana-hqstore-jacorb/74/) failed for two reasons:
1) qa test failures because of a change of netty version: NoClassDefFoundError: org/jboss/netty/buffer/ChannelBuffers
2) org.jboss.jbossts.qa.junit.TaskImpl stuck waiting on a lock (jstack trace attached)
