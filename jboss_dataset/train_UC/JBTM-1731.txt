Narayana release process doesn't rev all versions in BT quickstarts
The following files still contain 5.0.0.M3-SNAPSHOT:


./blacktie/messaging/basic/client.c 
./blacktie/xatmi/queues/makefile
./blacktie/test/blacktie-linux.sh
./blacktie/test/blacktie-vc9x32.bat   

Need to update the $NARAYANA_SRC/scripts/pre-release.sh script to change these. Look for the lines that start "find . -name".
