Simplify XTS JBossAS7ServerKillProcessor by making linux only
We've had many problems with JBossAS7ServerKillProcessor and it's turned into quite a complex beast. By making it linux only, we can stop using the jboss-cli.sh which has been causing IPv6 issues. Also we can run linux shell commands which tend to be simpler.

The tests only run on Linux anyway, as there are other Linux only tests.
