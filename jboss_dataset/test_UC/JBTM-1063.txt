Create a script in scripts/hudson to that hudson can call to build narayana
We need a script in script/hudson to build Narayana.

This idea is seeded from the blacktie project, so check how the script side of things works in there.

Path variables such as JAVA_HOME and ANT should be configured outside the script, see:
http://albany/view/Narayana+BlackTie/job/blacktie-linux32/configure

For more information.

As a starter for 10 this is the configuration in the current Job:

# THIS IS REQUIRED SO THAT THE BUILD CAN FIND jconsole.jar
./build.sh install
cd qa
sed -i TaskImpl.properties -e "s#^COMMAND_LINE_0=.*#COMMAND_LINE_0=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_26/bin/java#"
/usr/local/apache-ant-1.7.1/bin/ant -Ddriver.url=file:///home/hudson/dbdrivers get.drivers dist
/usr/local/apache-ant-1.7.1/bin/ant -f run-tests.xml ci-tests


The script should also execute the following XTS tests:
The script should use AS 7.1.1.Final. The script can download this from: http://172.17.131.2/userContent/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip
Make sure the poms for the following tests reference the correct version of arquillian* to match this version of AS7
1. WSTX11 interop
2. XTS Unit tests
3. XTS crash rec tests 
   Run simplifylogs: java -cp target/classes/ com.arjuna.qa.simplifylogs.SimplifyLogs ./target/log/ ./target/log-simplified
   (configure the build to archive <XTS_CRASH_REC_ROOT>/target/log/ target/log/simplified)

(Findbugs and bmcheck will obviously be ran by ./build.sh install at the start - and findbugs should not fail the build if it finds bugs, although bmcheck can)
