Review the project structure of XTS
The structure of the XTS project needs reviewing. Things to look out for:

# Check for ant build scripts and delete/mavenize as appropriate
# Ensure all source directories follow the default maven structure
# Move unit tests into the sub component that they test
# Ensure consistent with the rest of the Narayana project
# Ensure all readme files are up-to-date
# Search for version numbers and check they are up-to-date. For example, some readme files state compatibility with certain (old) version of JBoss AS.
# General review
