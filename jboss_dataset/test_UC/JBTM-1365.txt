Deploy REST-AT support as a JBossAS subsystem and module
Currently a user of REST-AT needs to deploy the coordinator and also create a new module for the REST-AT client support. It would be a lot easier for developers if this was already deployed as part of AS7.

I think the way to do this is to create a sub-system for the coordinator (like what we do for the XTS coordinator) and a module for the REST-AT libraries (again, similar to XTS).

The subsystem would need to:

* Bootstrap the coordinator. Currently bootstrapping occurs when the coordinator war is deployed. As there will be no war, the subsystem needs to take care of this bootstrapping.
* Deploy the coordinator endpoint.

The module would need to contain the REST-AT coordinator code and the client libraries.

Need to check with the AS team to see if we add a new Subsystem or make do with an existing one. We can't start this work until this is resolved.
