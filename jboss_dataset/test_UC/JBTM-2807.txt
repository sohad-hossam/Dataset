StoreManager return always the same store
StoreManager.get*Store() returns always the same store even after changing it via BeanPopulator.

Problem is that StoreManager.actionStore, StoreManager.stateStore, StoreManager.communicationStore won't change after they are set for the first time.

this method should null stores.
