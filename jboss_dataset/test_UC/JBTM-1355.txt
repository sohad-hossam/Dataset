Merge XTS JUnit and Arquillian tests
When migrating the XTS tests to Arquillian, we wanted to make sure that the old tests where still functional whilst the Arquillian counterparts stabilized. As a result we now have two classes for each test. The Arquillian test delegates each @Test method to the corresponding @Test in the old suite.

For example: 

We have the actual test in:

./XTS/localjunit/WSTX/src/main/java/com/arjuna/wst11/tests/arq/ba/MultiClose.java

And then a Arquillian JUnit test which just calls the test methods above is here: 

./XTS/localjunit/WSTX/src/test/java/com/arjuna/wst11/tests/arq/ba/MultiCloseTest.java

To resolve this issue, we should remove the tests under './XTS/localjunit/WSTX/src/main/java' and merge the test methods into Arquillian test. At the end of this process "./XTS/localjunit/WSTX/src/main" should be empty (and thus removed).

This applies to most, if not all suites under "./XTS/localjunit/".
