Implement JMS integration classes
Both Spring and Spring Boot requires ConnectionFactory, Connection, Session implementation which should handle the transaction related tasks when using JMS e.g. enlisting xa resources, registering synchronizations etc.
This should be somethings similar to the ConnectionManager and ConnectionImple used by the transactional driver.
