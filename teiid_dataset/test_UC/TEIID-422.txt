Issue with Teiid SOAP War on JBoss 4.2.3 GA
Some issues discovered running the Teiid SOAP war on JBoss 4.2.3...

1.) The log location is relative which worked for our kitted Tomcat deployment where we knew the directory structure. Need an alternative for deployment in a JBossAS container.
2.) Getting JSP compiler errors on the index page... for example: 

An error occurred at line: 89 in the jsp file: /index.jsp
The method getContextpath() is undefined for the type HttpServletRequest

3.) The anonymous username used for getting the WSDL was changed in the Membership interface, but no the client.
4.) A class loading issue related the MetaMatrixAuthenticationException class.
5.) MAR files are corrupt in the teiid-soap project
