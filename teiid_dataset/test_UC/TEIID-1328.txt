API request:  Programatically modify the VDB
I'd like an API to programatically modify the VDB.  It would be ideal to modify the VDB using DDL through Teiid.  Our primary use case is accessing a dynamic set of datasources through Teiid.  When a datasource is added, we would INSERT the appropriate entries into MODEL, PROPERTIES, DATASOURCES tables.  Teiid would reread the appropriate metadata from the associated translators.
