with clause used by subquery repeated in the subquery
A query such as:

with eee as (select * from pm1.g1) select * from pm1.g2 where pm1.g2.e1 in (select e1 from eee)

will result in a push down that repeats the with clause in the subquery:

... (with eee ... select e1 from eee)

It is sufficient to rely on the parent to define the common table.
