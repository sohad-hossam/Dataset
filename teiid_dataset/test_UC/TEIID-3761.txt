OData V2: The property based response and Function based responses are incorrect per specification
The property request like
{code}
http://localhost:8080/odata/vdb/table/property
http://localhost:8080/odata/vdb/table/property/$value
{code}
needs to return a property based response, instead they are returning the "entity" based response.

The function with simple scalar return, should return just simple data 
{code}
http://localhost:8080/odata/vdb/func?param=value
{code}
instead it returning the collection based data
