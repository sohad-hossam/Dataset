ORA-32039: recursive WITH clause must have column alias list
If running a WITH table AS(...) query to Oracle and the query schema name is the same as the subquery name i.e. EWI.  you receive the Oracle error:

ORA-32039: recursive WITH clause must have column alias list

If you modify the query to 
WITH EWI1 AS ....
then it works.

f.ex:
breaking:       WITH tbl AS (
where tbl = a common table name in the current schema and the common table definition as (...) references a view in that schema. Oracle will complain with this erroneous error.  

work-around: WITH tbl_1 AS(
where tbl_1 does not exist as a current schema/table name.
