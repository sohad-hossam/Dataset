Teiid selects incorrect source when conformed table is included in SQL JOIN
I have two models.  postgres for PostgreSQL and mysql for MySQL. I have table test.conformedTable in the both models
and I have configured conformedTable to be conformed. Table tablepostgre is in the PostgreSQL database. Table tablemysql in the MySQL.

I want to join conformedTable with tablepostgre and tablemysql.

The query
select a.*,b.* from mysql.test.conformedTable as a, tablemysql b where a.id=b.id
is processed OK, but query
select a.*,b.* from mysql.test.conformedTable as a, tablepostgre b where a.id=b.id throws an exception (in the attachment)

It seems that teiid searches tablepostgre in the mysql database, but the table is in the postgresql
