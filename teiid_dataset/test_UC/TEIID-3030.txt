Update Saxon to current release (9.5.x)
Our product embeds a Teiid server and provides its own set of 3rd party jar files, one of which clashes with Teiid: we provide Saxon-HE 9.4.0.6 and Teiid provides 9.2.1.5. These two versions are NOT binary compatible. 

This shows up using the web services connector as a class not found error because some classes have been repackaged between Saxon 9.2.x and 9.4.x.

If Teiid updates to the latest version (9.5), so can we, and avoid backporting our Saxon dependencies.
