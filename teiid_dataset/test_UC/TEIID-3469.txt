Incorrect DDL Schema when importing from Teiid Data Source Connection using Informix translator
When importing from Teiid Data Source Connection using an Informix Translator, an incorrect schema DDL is set as "catalog"."schema"."table-name" instead of "catalog":"schema"."table-name", the delimiter between catalog and schema is set to '.' but Informix uses ':'.

The '.' character must be replaced by a ':' between catalog and schema name when importing from Teiid Data Source Connection using Informix translator.

useCatalogName attribute could be set to false as a workaround to this and ignore the occurance of "catalog".
