OData v4 - definition of OData-Isolation header is either being ignored or is not implemented correctly
Teiid does not process header *OData-Isolation: snapshot* defined in request correctly.
* if service (Teiid) does not support this option it must return error 412
* if Teiid does supports this option then it is not processed correctly, because modifications made during request are visbile
