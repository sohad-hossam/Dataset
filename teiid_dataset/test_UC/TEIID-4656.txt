parseTimestamp issue with Oracle
parseTimestamp is pushed as to_timestamp.  However TO_TIMESTAMP is not generally valid unless the format string covers the entire string input value otherwise there is an exception about the picture ending.  

This means in general that we cannot pushdown the parseDate/Time/Timestamp operations to oracle as that is behavioral different with the java format routines, which will process just to the end of the format string.
