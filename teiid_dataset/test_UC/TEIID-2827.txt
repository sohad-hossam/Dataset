Can the teiid object associated with where the problem is found be added to the error message
Using the attached dynamic vdb, against the database that was created using the attached DDL, produces the following errors:

ERROR: Element Perf.HISTORY."TIME" of history is neither nullable nor has a default value. A value must be specified in the insert.
ERROR: Element Perf.HISTORY.FILL of history is neither nullable nor has a default value. A value must be specified in the insert.

Because of these errors, the VDB isn't deployed.
Not sure why these are not just WARNINGS.
