Document/expand sequence support
Currently sequence workaround logic only exists for oracle and is undocumented.  We should look at expanding sequence support - even for dynamic vdbs, see SQuriel's handling of system queries for retrieving sequence metadata.

At least allowing the workaround logic to work for all sources that support sequences (Postgres, DB2, etc.) would be good.
