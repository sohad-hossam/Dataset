Teiid assumes fqns in transformations, but they are no longer required to be there
It looks like with the uuid refactoring we no long maintain that the designer indexed transformations will contain only fully qualified group names.  

This will cause a good deal of problems at runtime as partially qualified names are subject to visibility rules and can conflict with session level tables.

I would prefer to address this on the teiid though better metadata logic, rather than requiring fqns in transformation queries.
