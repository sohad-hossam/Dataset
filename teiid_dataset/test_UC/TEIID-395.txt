Command Log logs a modfieid version of MMCommand
The FileCommandLogger may be logging a different user command than the command the user actually submitted.  This was originally reported on 5.5.3 and may not affect Teiid but it should be verified and fixed if needed.

Also, the tracking service interface should be modified to accept a String as the SQL command instead of a Command object.  The Command object serves no purpose to the tracking service and a String will produce less overhead.
