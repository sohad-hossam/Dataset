Class files checked into Git
It looks like a large number of class files were accidentally checked into Git. This is generally considered bad practice. The files are in the salesforce-api and google-api modules.

Can verify using the Github file search. https://github.com/teiid/teiid/find/master (type ".class", not sure how to link to it).

Can do something like this to remove them:
{code}
find . -name '*.class' -exec git rm {} \;
{code}
